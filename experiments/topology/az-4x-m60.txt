Legend:

X   = Self
SOC  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as the SMP link between CPU sockets(e.g. QPI)
PHB  = Connection traversing PCIe as well as a PCIe Host Bridge (typically the CPU)
PXB  = Connection traversing multiple PCIe switches (without traversing the PCIe Host Bridge)
PIX  = Connection traversing a single PCIe switch
NV#  = Connection traversing a bonded set of # NVLinks

SOC between all pairs looks a bit suspicious...
